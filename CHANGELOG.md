# Changelog

Radar is alpha: breaking changes are expected and bump the minor version. The wire revision (`radar --version` prints it) is the compatibility contract with pi-radar; the version is for people.

## 0.2.0

- Sessions attach through one verified presence claim; manually started Pi sessions are adopted without an operator step.
- The agent is published as `subject_id` and an attachment as `claim_id`; `execution_id` and `execution_generation` are gone. Wire revision 5 — restart the daemon with pi-radar 0.6.0.
- `D` is the single delete key and ends nested agents gracefully before closing a place.
- `radar --version`, a clap command line, and shell completions.
